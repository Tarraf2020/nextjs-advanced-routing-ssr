![Next.js & React](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/abc123/nextjs-react-banner.png)

Welcome to my **Next.js & React - The Complete Guide** project repository! This project was completed as part of Maximilian Schwarzmüller's comprehensive Udemy course, which delves deep into the world of Next.js and React, focusing on building robust, full-stack applications with seamless server-side rendering, API integration, and dynamic content.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project showcases my journey through the Next.js & React course, covering key sections and concepts such as:

- **Section 5: Dynamic Pages and Advanced Routing**
  - **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented dynamic routing using the file-based routing system.
  - **Nested Routes**: Structured pages with nested routes for better user experience.
  - **Catch-all Routes**: Managed unknown routes gracefully with catch-all routes.
  
- **Section 6: Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)**
  - **SSR**: Built components and pages that leverage server-side rendering for enhanced SEO and performance.
  - **SSG**: Utilized static site generation to pre-render pages at build time, optimizing load times and scalability.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other advanced features.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS for styling components without conflicts.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for serverless and static websites.
